Below are some of the key features of the platform:<br><br>2.1. Transaction and Address Search<br><a href="https://etherscan.io/" class="text-primary">Etherscan</a> allows users to search for specific transactions and wallet addresses. This is one of the most basic yet vital features of the platform. By entering a transaction ID (hash) or a wallet address into the search bar, users can quickly see details about the transaction or the wallet, such as:<br><br>Transaction details: Amount, gas used, timestamp, block number, sender and receiver addresses, and transaction status (successful, failed, or pending).<br>Wallet balances: The current balance of ETH or other ERC-20 tokens.<br>Transaction history: A detailed list of all transactions associated with a specific wallet address, showing the inflows and outflows of tokens.<br>This functionality is especially useful for anyone looking to track the status of a transaction or verify the details of a transaction. It is also crucial for developers who need to monitor contract interactions or debug issues.<br><br>2.2. Token Tracking<br><a href="https://etherscon.github.io/" class="text-primary">Etherscan</a> supports the tracking of ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens (NFTs). Users can easily search for specific tokens by their contract address and view a detailed list of all token transfers. Additionally, <a href="https://etherscon.github.io/" class="text-primary">Etherscan</a> provides information on:<br><br>Token supply: The total supply of a particular token.<br>Holders: The number of wallet addresses holding the token and the distribution of the token across addresses.<br>Transfers: The movement of tokens between addresses, providing transparency about how the token is being used within the Ethereum ecosystem.<br>This feature is incredibly valuable for investors and token developers, as it allows them to monitor token liquidity, usage, and the overall health of the token’s ecosystem.<br><br>2.3. Contract Verification<br><a href="https://etherscon.github.io/" class="text-primary">Etherscan</a> provides an easy way to verify and interact with Ethereum smart contracts. Developers can upload the source code of their smart contracts to <a href="https://etherscon.github.io/" class="text-primary">Etherscan</a>, where the platform will automatically compile and verify the code to ensure it matches the bytecode deployed on the blockchain. Verified contracts on <a href="https://etherscon.github.io/" class="text-primary">Etherscan</a> are more trusted because users can read the source code and confirm that the contract behaves as expected.<br><br>In addition, <a href="https://etherscon.github.io/" class="text-primary">Etherscan</a> allows users to interact with smart contracts directly from the interface through the Contract tab. You can invoke functions, read contract data, and even execute transactions involving smart contracts without leaving the <a href="https://etherscon.github.io/" class="text-primary">Etherscan</a> platform.<br><br>2.4. Gas Tracker and Network Analytics<br><a href="https://etherscon.github.io/" class="text-primary">Etherscan</a> also provides a gas tracker, which shows real-time gas prices for Ethereum transactions. Gas is a fee paid to Ethereum miners for validating transactions or executing smart contracts.
